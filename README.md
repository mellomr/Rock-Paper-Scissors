# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It is designed to play against the computer but if you would like to me to add an option where two people can play just ask.

Simply type in how many goes you want.
Then choose your attack. Press R for Rock , P for Paper, S for Scissors
The computer will then throw its attack. You will either gain a point or stay the same
After your games have ended the scores will be shown and you will be asked to play again


Feel free to re-create the project but please do not copy line for line.
